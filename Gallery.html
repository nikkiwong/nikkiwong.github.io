        <p>Digital art is something I've always been interested in. I started off drawing on a website called ratemydrawings.com and at that time I never thought it would be possible because I only had a mouse to draw with. But there I learnt a lot of skills where I can now apply to photoshop or other programs where I can draw. For more samples of my work please check out the digital art section of my gallery.I don't have so much time to write a lot here so I'm just typing right now just to fill some space.. so I guess you can stop reading if you want. It's just to make the page look fuller. tap tap tap tap I guess I could just start typing random letters but words probably look better than a lot of random letters. Ok I think it looks better now.. I will just copy and paste this to all the pages. APologise its not very interesting to read. THanks.</p>

        <p>I have been drawing traditionally for as long as I can remember. I started when I was able to hold a pencil. From there I have experimented with many different styles of art. I originally started with pen and paper and slowly progressed to acrylics and finally to watercolour.
