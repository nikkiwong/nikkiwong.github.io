    Since I was a child I've always had a passion for food. I love sharing joy and happiness with people through food. No words can describe the utter joy and happiness I feel when people tell me that they really enjoyed it or that it's the best vegan/gluten free food they've ever had. Seeing the smiles on their faces is more than enough to keep me going with Two Bytes.

      <h3>Our story:</h3>
  <p>
    Soo..... where do I begin?
  </p>
  <p>I've been trying out lots of different foods over the last few years and I always noticed that the special dietary food products
  are much more expensive than the "normal" foods. I understand that sometimes the ingredients used are a bit more expensive, but sometimes the cost is double or even
triple that of the norm. </p>
<p>I started baking a lot for my partner because he is always very busy and on the go, so it was handy to have some food for him that was easy to take with
him when he's rushing out. He used to grab processed foods like cereal bars, crisps, biscuits... things that are full of refined sugars and little of anything good for you. So I decided
to be his personal baker and feed him healthier snacks! </p>
<p>While on my adventure to create this healthy snacks, I was looking up gluten free recipes and inventing my own because on of my best friends just found out she is intolerant to
a lot of foods! So I thought, challenge accepted! </p>
<p>Shortly after, a few of my friends converted to veganism. I also support veganism and believe that it is a solution to save our planet as well as the animals themselves therefore I decided to take it upon myself to bake vegan friendly
foods to show my support! It was challenging and you probably know that most baked goods use eggs or milk in some form or another.</p>
<p>Finally the asian fusion comes from my childhood of watching my wonderful mother bake and cook all the time for us, so naturally I have a passion for the asian cuisine... and since doing research on veganism and gluten free ingredients, the asian cuisine is actually quite vegan friendly and gluten free! A win-win situation! </p>
